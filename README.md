## 🧱 1️⃣ Reliability Levels

| Level | Status | Description | Transition |
| :----: | :------ | :----------- | :----------- |
| **-1** | 💀 **Undead** | Suspicious or inconsistent behavior, lack of transparency. | Can return to **0** or **1** after clarification. |
| **0**  | 👻 **Ghost** | New account (< 1 year) or inactive: neutral presence, not yet evaluated. | Becomes **1** through consistency and coherence. |
| **1**  | 🌿 **Living** | Reliable, coherent, transparent interactions. | Can fall to **-1** if suspicion arises. |

💡 **Official rule:**
- < 1 year → level **0**  
- > 1 year → level **1** or **-1**, depending on transparency and coherence.

## 🔥 2️⃣ Streaks (Consistency)

| Duration | Weapon | Material | Meaning |
| :------: | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| **< 1 week** | 🪵 **Wooden Staff** | Wood | Early engagement, intention forming. |
| **≥ 1 week** | ⚔️ **Iron Weapon** | Iron | Proven constancy, reinforced credibility. |

💡 The **streak** is the visible proof of consistency — the ritual action that builds trust over time.
